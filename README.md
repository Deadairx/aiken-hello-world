# Auto generated stuff
(everything below was auto generated by the Project initializer)


Write validators in the `validators` folder, and supporting functions in the `lib` folder using `.ak` as a file extension.

For example, as `validators/always_true.ak`

```gleam
validator {
  fn spend(_datum: Data, _redeemer: Data, _context: Data) -> Bool {
    True
  }
}
```

Validators are named after their purpose, so one of:

- `spent`
- `mint`
- `withdraw`
- `publish`

## Building

```sh
aiken build
```

## Testing

You can write tests in any module using the `test` keyword. For example:

```gleam
test foo() {
  1 + 1 == 2
}
```

To run all tests, simply do:

```sh
aiken check
```

To run only tests matching the string `foo`, do:

```sh
aiken check -m foo
```

## Documentation

If you're writing a library, you might want to generate an HTML documentation for it.

Use:

```sh
aiken docs
```
